FlickrUI
========

My application runs a recent photo search on opening. To search for certain text use the search bar to the left. For more options such as searching by username, date uploaded since, and date uploaded until you can toggle the "More Features" button. When no parameters are passed through the application returns recently posted photos. On clicking the photo the user is brought to the page where the photo is posted from the original flickr page it was posted on.

The background is white to keep the page simple and the focus on the content. One search input form makes the application even similar, but the user can choose to add more complicated search parameters. This satisfies the minimalist heuristic and also the flexibility and ability of use heuristic, because the application caters to both experienced and not experienced users. The user can also hide and show the additional features as they would like, and can perform multiple searches which follows the user control and freedom heuristic.
